      <h2> Your Mad-Lib </h2>
      <p> Once upon a time there was a prince who lived in the land far far away. This prince had a problem with all of the people living in <span class = "place"></span>. They kept on <span class = "verbing"></span>. One day the <span class= "adj"></span> prince got so fed up with all of the nonsense that was happening in his kingdom. He said loudly, "from this point on, I will not allow <span class = "verbing"></span>. Anyone who gets caught <span class = "verbing"></span> will have to kiss Bob." And from that point on, the prince had no problem with <span class = "verbing"></span>. </p>
